# Microprocessor Programs and Tools

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to serving two main objectives. Firstly, it hosts a myriad of microprocessor programs, providing a practical approach to diverse microprocessor concepts. Coupled with additional resources, the aim is to bolster the learning process for students. Secondly, the repository is structured to act as a dataset for an intuitive, easy-to-navigate application built for engineering students. By immersing themselves in the repository's contents, users can gain a profound understanding of the practical applications of microprocessor concepts.

## Repository Structure
- [Programs](./programs/README.md): 
  - [8085](./programs/8085/README.md): This directory is dedicated to the 8085 microprocessor. It contains program questions and their corresponding answers, designed to give a comprehensive overview of the 8085 microprocessor's functionalities.
  
  - [8086](./programs/8086/README.md): This directory focuses on the 8086 microprocessor, hosting program questions and their solutions to provide insights into the 8086 microprocessor's workings.
  
- [Software & Online Tools](./softwares/README.md): Curated especially for those delving into assembly programs, this section lists software utilities and online platforms crucial for understanding, running, and simulating assembly code in microprocessor contexts.
