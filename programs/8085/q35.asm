; A set of eight data bytes (4 Pairs) are stored in memory locations starting from
; 1040H. WAP to add two bytes at a time and store the sum in same memory location,
; sum replacing the first byte and the carry replacing the second byte. If any pair
; does not generate a carry,the memory location of the second byte should be cleared
; i.e. store 00H over there.
