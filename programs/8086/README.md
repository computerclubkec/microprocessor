# 8086 Programs

This directory contains assembly language programs for Intel 8086. The questions listed here falls under the syllabus of IOE(Institute of Engineering).

## Programs

- [x] [q1](q1.asm): Write a program for 8086 to add two 8-bit numbers stored in data1 and data2. Store the result in the variable 'result' and display it in ASCII format.
- [x] [q2](q2.asm): Write a program in 8086 assembly to find the largest 8-bit number in an array and display it in ASCII format.
- [x] [q3](q3.asm): Write an assembly language program to input string and display it at middle of the screen.
- [x] [q4](q4.asm): Write an assembly language program to display words of the sentence in separate lines and to count the number of words presented in the entered sentence.
- [x] [q5](q5.asm): Write an assembly language program to get nth number from the user and sum the odd numbers from 1 to nth term and display sum. [sum = n2]
- [x] [q6](q6.asm): Write an assembly language program to perform the addition of numbers from 1 to n, where n being entered number by user having 3 digits.
- [x] [q7](q7.asm): Write an ALP in 8086 to read a string in parametric way and display number of vowels and digits in clear window.(2079, Back)
- [x] [q8](q8.asm): Write down an assembly language program to read a string and count the no of vowels in the string. Display the no of vowels in the string and the string without the vowels in it in a clear screen with reverse attribute.
- [x] [q9](q9.asm): Write an assembly language program to get string input; count no. of vowels and display message ‘even vowels’ on the screen if the count is even otherwise display ‘odd vowels’.
- [x] [q10](q10.asm): Write an assembly language program for 8086 to read string count the number of vowels in the string and display the string and its vowels count in a clear screen.
- [x] [q11](q11.asm): Write assembly language program for 8086 to sort five numbers in ascending and descending order.
- [x] [q12](q12.asm): Write an assembly language program to read a string from the user, convert it to upper case, count the number of words and display each word in each line and number of words.
- [x] [q13](q13.asm): Write an 8086 assembly language program to sort ten 16-bit data stored in a table and display the numbers as decimal numbers in the screen.
